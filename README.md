<td>I have a few rules that I like to fall back on when I'm creating anything whether it's coding or building, these rules help to guide me:
<ul>
<li>If you're already building it, make it stand out.</li>
<li>Treat everything you create as if your name is on it.</li>
<li>True quality can be found in the small details.</li>
</ul>

People easily forget the larger picture but will
always remember and be suprised at the attention to detail in the smallest things.
